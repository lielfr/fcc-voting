This is my solution for FCC's voting challenge. For more information, please visit this page: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app.

In order to run this app, you should create a file called config.js with this structure:

var config = {
  auth: {
    consumerKey: '',
    consumerSecret: '',
    callbackURL: ''
  },
  db: {
    mongoURL: 'a'
  },
  session: {
    secret: ''
  }
};

module.exports = config;
